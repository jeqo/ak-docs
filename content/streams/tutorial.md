# Tutorial: Write a Kafka Streams Application

In this guide we will start from scratch on setting up your own project
to write a stream processing application using Kafka Streams. It is
highly recommended to read the
[quickstart](/%7B%7Bversion%7D%7D/documentation/streams/quickstart)
first on how to run a Streams application written in Kafka Streams if
you have not done so.

## Setting up a Maven Project {#tutorial_maven_setup .anchor-link}

We are going to use a Kafka Streams Maven Archetype for creating a
Streams project structure with the following commands:

``` line-numbers
mvn archetype:generate \
    -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apache.kafka \
    -DarchetypeArtifactId=streams-quickstart-java \
    -DarchetypeVersion={{fullDotVersion}} \
    -DgroupId=streams.examples \
    -DartifactId=streams.examples \
    -Dversion=0.1 \
    -Dpackage=myapps
```

You can use a different value for `groupId`, `artifactId` and `package`
parameters if you like. Assuming the above parameter values are used,
this command will create a project structure that looks like this:

``` line-numbers
> tree streams.examples
    streams-quickstart
    |-- pom.xml
    |-- src
        |-- main
            |-- java
            |   |-- myapps
            |       |-- LineSplit.java
            |       |-- Pipe.java
            |       |-- WordCount.java
            |-- resources
                |-- log4j.properties
```

The `pom.xml` file included in the project already has the Streams
dependency defined. Note, that the generated `pom.xml` targets Java 8,
and does not work with higher Java versions.

There are already several example programs written with Streams library
under `src/main/java`. Since we are going to start writing such programs
from scratch, we can now delete these examples:

``` line-numbers
> cd streams-quickstart
> rm src/main/java/myapps/*.java
```

## Writing a first Streams application: Pipe {#tutorial_code_pipe}

It\'s coding time now! Feel free to open your favorite IDE and import
this Maven project, or simply open a text editor and create a java file
under `src/main/java/myapps`. Let\'s name it `Pipe.java`:

``` line-numbers
package myapps;

public class Pipe {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {

    }
}
```

We are going to fill in the `main` function to write this pipe program.
Note that we will not list the import statements as we go since IDEs can
usually add them automatically. However if you are using a text editor
you need to manually add the imports, and at the end of this section
we\'ll show the complete code snippet with import statement for you.

The first step to write a Streams application is to create a
`java.util.Properties` map to specify different Streams execution
configuration values as defined in `StreamsConfig`. A couple of
important configuration values you need to set are:
`StreamsConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG`, which specifies a list of
host/port pairs to use for establishing the initial connection to the
Kafka cluster, and `StreamsConfig.APPLICATION_ID_CONFIG`, which gives
the unique identifier of your Streams application to distinguish itself
with other applications talking to the same Kafka cluster:

``` line-numbers
Properties props = new Properties();
props.put(StreamsConfig.APPLICATION_ID_CONFIG, "streams-pipe");
props.put(StreamsConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, "localhost:9092");    // assuming that the Kafka broker this application is talking to runs on local machine with port 9092
```

In addition, you can customize other configurations in the same map, for
example, default serialization and deserialization libraries for the
record key-value pairs:

``` line-numbers
props.put(StreamsConfig.DEFAULT_KEY_SERDE_CLASS_CONFIG, Serdes.String().getClass());
props.put(StreamsConfig.DEFAULT_VALUE_SERDE_CLASS_CONFIG, Serdes.String().getClass());
```

For a full list of configurations of Kafka Streams please refer to this
[table](/%7B%7Bversion%7D%7D/documentation/#streamsconfigs).

Next we will define the computational logic of our Streams application.
In Kafka Streams this computational logic is defined as a `topology` of
connected processor nodes. We can use a topology builder to construct
such a topology,

``` line-numbers
final StreamsBuilder builder = new StreamsBuilder();
```

And then create a source stream from a Kafka topic named
`streams-plaintext-input` using this topology builder:

``` line-numbers
KStream<String, String> source = builder.stream("streams-plaintext-input");
```

Now we get a `KStream` that is continuously generating records from its
source Kafka topic `streams-plaintext-input`. The records are organized
as `String` typed key-value pairs. The simplest thing we can do with
this stream is to write it into another Kafka topic, say it\'s named
`streams-pipe-output`:

``` line-numbers
source.to("streams-pipe-output");
```

Note that we can also concatenate the above two lines into a single line
as:

``` line-numbers
builder.stream("streams-plaintext-input").to("streams-pipe-output");
```

We can inspect what kind of `topology` is created from this builder by
doing the following:

``` line-numbers
final Topology topology = builder.build();
```

And print its description to standard output as:

``` line-numbers
System.out.println(topology.describe());
```

If we just stop here, compile and run the program, it will output the
following information:

``` line-numbers
> mvn clean package
> mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=myapps.Pipe
Sub-topologies:
  Sub-topology: 0
    Source: KSTREAM-SOURCE-0000000000(topics: streams-plaintext-input) --> KSTREAM-SINK-0000000001
    Sink: KSTREAM-SINK-0000000001(topic: streams-pipe-output) <-- KSTREAM-SOURCE-0000000000
Global Stores:
  none
```

As shown above, it illustrates that the constructed topology has two
processor nodes, a source node `KSTREAM-SOURCE-0000000000` and a sink
node `KSTREAM-SINK-0000000001`. `KSTREAM-SOURCE-0000000000` continuously
read records from Kafka topic `streams-plaintext-input` and pipe them to
its downstream node `KSTREAM-SINK-0000000001`; `KSTREAM-SINK-0000000001`
will write each of its received record in order to another Kafka topic
`streams-pipe-output` (the `-->` and `<--` arrows dictates the
downstream and upstream processor nodes of this node, i.e. \"children\"
and \"parents\" within the topology graph). It also illustrates that
this simple topology has no global state stores associated with it (we
will talk about state stores more in the following sections).

Note that we can always describe the topology as we did above at any
given point while we are building it in the code, so as a user you can
interactively \"try and taste\" your computational logic defined in the
topology until you are happy with it. Suppose we are already done with
this simple topology that just pipes data from one Kafka topic to
another in an endless streaming manner, we can now construct the Streams
client with the two components we have just constructed above: the
configuration map specified in a `java.util.Properties` instance and the
`Topology` object.

``` line-numbers
final KafkaStreams streams = new KafkaStreams(topology, props);
```

By calling its `start()` function we can trigger the execution of this
client. The execution won\'t stop until `close()` is called on this
client. We can, for example, add a shutdown hook with a countdown latch
to capture a user interrupt and close the client upon terminating this
program:

``` line-numbers
final CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(1);

// attach shutdown handler to catch control-c
Runtime.getRuntime().addShutdownHook(new Thread("streams-shutdown-hook") {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        streams.close();
        latch.countDown();
    }
});

try {
    streams.start();
    latch.await();
} catch (Throwable e) {
    System.exit(1);
}
System.exit(0);
```

The complete code so far looks like this:

``` line-numbers
package myapps;

import org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.Serdes;
import org.apache.kafka.streams.KafkaStreams;
import org.apache.kafka.streams.StreamsBuilder;
import org.apache.kafka.streams.StreamsConfig;
import org.apache.kafka.streams.Topology;

import java.util.Properties;
import java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch;

public class Pipe {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Properties props = new Properties();
        props.put(StreamsConfig.APPLICATION_ID_CONFIG, "streams-pipe");
        props.put(StreamsConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, "localhost:9092");
        props.put(StreamsConfig.DEFAULT_KEY_SERDE_CLASS_CONFIG, Serdes.String().getClass());
        props.put(StreamsConfig.DEFAULT_VALUE_SERDE_CLASS_CONFIG, Serdes.String().getClass());

        final StreamsBuilder builder = new StreamsBuilder();

        builder.stream("streams-plaintext-input").to("streams-pipe-output");

        final Topology topology = builder.build();

        final KafkaStreams streams = new KafkaStreams(topology, props);
        final CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(1);

        // attach shutdown handler to catch control-c
        Runtime.getRuntime().addShutdownHook(new Thread("streams-shutdown-hook") {
            @Override
            public void run() {
                streams.close();
                latch.countDown();
            }
        });

        try {
            streams.start();
            latch.await();
        } catch (Throwable e) {
            System.exit(1);
        }
        System.exit(0);
    }
}
```

If you already have the Kafka broker up and running at `localhost:9092`,
and the topics `streams-plaintext-input` and `streams-pipe-output`
created on that broker, you can run this code in your IDE or on the
command line, using Maven:

``` line-numbers
> mvn clean package
> mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=myapps.Pipe
```

For detailed instructions on how to run a Streams application and
observe its computing results, please read the [Play with a Streams
Application](/%7B%7Bversion%7D%7D/documentation/streams/quickstart)
section. We will not talk about this in the rest of this section.

## Writing a second Streams application: Line Split {#tutorial_code_linesplit}

We have learned how to construct a Streams client with its two key
components: the `StreamsConfig` and `Topology`. Now let\'s move on to
add some real processing logic by augmenting the current topology. We
can first create another program by first copy the existing `Pipe.java`
class:

``` line-numbers
> cp src/main/java/myapps/Pipe.java src/main/java/myapps/LineSplit.java
```

And change its class name as well as the application id config to
distinguish with the original program:

``` line-numbers
public class LineSplit {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Properties props = new Properties();
        props.put(StreamsConfig.APPLICATION_ID_CONFIG, "streams-linesplit");
        // ...
    }
}
```

Since each of the source stream\'s record is a `String` typed key-value
pair, let\'s treat the value string as a text line and split it into
words with a `FlatMapValues` operator:

``` line-numbers
KStream<String, String> source = builder.stream("streams-plaintext-input");
KStream<String, String> words = source.flatMapValues(new ValueMapper<String, Iterable<String>>() {
            @Override
            public Iterable<String> apply(String value) {
                return Arrays.asList(value.split("\\W+"));
            }
        });
```

The operator will take the `source` stream as its input, and generate a
new stream named `words` by processing each record from its source
stream in order and breaking its value string into a list of words, and
producing each word as a new record to the output `words` stream. This
is a stateless operator that does not need to keep track of any
previously received records or processed results. Note if you are using
JDK 8 you can use lambda expression and simplify the above code as:

``` line-numbers
KStream<String, String> source = builder.stream("streams-plaintext-input");
KStream<String, String> words = source.flatMapValues(value -> Arrays.asList(value.split("\\W+")));
```

And finally we can write the word stream back into another Kafka topic,
say `streams-linesplit-output`. Again, these two steps can be
concatenated as the following (assuming lambda expression is used):

``` line-numbers
KStream<String, String> source = builder.stream("streams-plaintext-input");
source.flatMapValues(value -> Arrays.asList(value.split("\\W+")))
      .to("streams-linesplit-output");
```

If we now describe this augmented topology as
`System.out.println(topology.describe())`, we will get the following:

``` line-numbers
> mvn clean package
> mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=myapps.LineSplit
Sub-topologies:
  Sub-topology: 0
    Source: KSTREAM-SOURCE-0000000000(topics: streams-plaintext-input) --> KSTREAM-FLATMAPVALUES-0000000001
    Processor: KSTREAM-FLATMAPVALUES-0000000001(stores: []) --> KSTREAM-SINK-0000000002 <-- KSTREAM-SOURCE-0000000000
    Sink: KSTREAM-SINK-0000000002(topic: streams-linesplit-output) <-- KSTREAM-FLATMAPVALUES-0000000001
  Global Stores:
    none
```

As we can see above, a new processor node
`KSTREAM-FLATMAPVALUES-0000000001` is injected into the topology between
the original source and sink nodes. It takes the source node as its
parent and the sink node as its child. In other words, each record
fetched by the source node will first traverse to the newly added
`KSTREAM-FLATMAPVALUES-0000000001` node to be processed, and one or more
new records will be generated as a result. They will continue traverse
down to the sink node to be written back to Kafka. Note this processor
node is \"stateless\" as it is not associated with any stores (i.e.
`(stores: [])`).

The complete code looks like this (assuming lambda expression is used):

``` line-numbers
package myapps;

import org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.Serdes;
import org.apache.kafka.streams.KafkaStreams;
import org.apache.kafka.streams.StreamsBuilder;
import org.apache.kafka.streams.StreamsConfig;
import org.apache.kafka.streams.Topology;
import org.apache.kafka.streams.kstream.KStream;

import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Properties;
import java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch;

public class LineSplit {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Properties props = new Properties();
        props.put(StreamsConfig.APPLICATION_ID_CONFIG, "streams-linesplit");
        props.put(StreamsConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, "localhost:9092");
        props.put(StreamsConfig.DEFAULT_KEY_SERDE_CLASS_CONFIG, Serdes.String().getClass());
        props.put(StreamsConfig.DEFAULT_VALUE_SERDE_CLASS_CONFIG, Serdes.String().getClass());

        final StreamsBuilder builder = new StreamsBuilder();

        KStream<String, String> source = builder.stream("streams-plaintext-input");
        source.flatMapValues(value -> Arrays.asList(value.split("\\W+")))
              .to("streams-linesplit-output");

        final Topology topology = builder.build();
        final KafkaStreams streams = new KafkaStreams(topology, props);
        final CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(1);

        // ... same as Pipe.java above
    }
}
```

## Writing a third Streams application: Wordcount {#tutorial_code_wordcount}

Let\'s now take a step further to add some \"stateful\" computations to
the topology by counting the occurrence of the words split from the
source text stream. Following similar steps let\'s create another
program based on the `LineSplit.java` class:

``` line-numbers
public class WordCount {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Properties props = new Properties();
        props.put(StreamsConfig.APPLICATION_ID_CONFIG, "streams-wordcount");
        // ...
    }
}
```

In order to count the words we can first modify the `flatMapValues`
operator to treat all of them as lower case (assuming lambda expression
is used):

``` line-numbers
source.flatMapValues(new ValueMapper<String, Iterable<String>>() {
    @Override
    public Iterable<String> apply(String value) {
        return Arrays.asList(value.toLowerCase(Locale.getDefault()).split("\\W+"));
    }
});
```

In order to do the counting aggregation we have to first specify that we
want to key the stream on the value string, i.e. the lower cased word,
with a `groupBy` operator. This operator generate a new grouped stream,
which can then be aggregated by a `count` operator, which generates a
running count on each of the grouped keys:

``` line-numbers
KTable<String, Long> counts =
source.flatMapValues(new ValueMapper<String, Iterable<String>>() {
            @Override
            public Iterable<String> apply(String value) {
                return Arrays.asList(value.toLowerCase(Locale.getDefault()).split("\\W+"));
            }
        })
      .groupBy(new KeyValueMapper<String, String, String>() {
           @Override
           public String apply(String key, String value) {
               return value;
           }
        })
      // Materialize the result into a KeyValueStore named "counts-store".
      // The Materialized store is always of type <Bytes, byte[]> as this is the format of the inner most store.
      .count(Materialized.<String, Long, KeyValueStore<Bytes, byte[]>> as("counts-store"));
```

Note that the `count` operator has a `Materialized` parameter that
specifies that the running count should be stored in a state store named
`counts-store`. This `counts-store` store can be queried in real-time,
with details described in the [Developer
Manual](/%7B%7Bversion%7D%7D/documentation/streams/developer-guide#streams_interactive_queries).

We can also write the `counts` KTable\'s changelog stream back into
another Kafka topic, say `streams-wordcount-output`. Because the result
is a changelog stream, the output topic `streams-wordcount-output`
should be configured with log compaction enabled. Note that this time
the value type is no longer `String` but `Long`, so the default
serialization classes are not viable for writing it to Kafka anymore. We
need to provide overridden serialization methods for `Long` types,
otherwise a runtime exception will be thrown:

``` line-numbers
counts.toStream().to("streams-wordcount-output", Produced.with(Serdes.String(), Serdes.Long()));
```

Note that in order to read the changelog stream from topic
`streams-wordcount-output`, one needs to set the value deserialization
as `org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.LongDeserializer`. Details of
this can be found in the [Play with a Streams
Application](/%7B%7Bversion%7D%7D/documentation/streams/quickstart)
section. Assuming lambda expression from JDK 8 can be used, the above
code can be simplified as:

``` line-numbers
KStream<String, String> source = builder.stream("streams-plaintext-input");
source.flatMapValues(value -> Arrays.asList(value.toLowerCase(Locale.getDefault()).split("\\W+")))
      .groupBy((key, value) -> value)
      .count(Materialized.<String, Long, KeyValueStore<Bytes, byte[]>>as("counts-store"))
      .toStream()
      .to("streams-wordcount-output", Produced.with(Serdes.String(), Serdes.Long()));
```

If we again describe this augmented topology as
`System.out.println(topology.describe())`, we will get the following:

``` line-numbers
> mvn clean package
> mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=myapps.WordCount
Sub-topologies:
  Sub-topology: 0
    Source: KSTREAM-SOURCE-0000000000(topics: streams-plaintext-input) --> KSTREAM-FLATMAPVALUES-0000000001
    Processor: KSTREAM-FLATMAPVALUES-0000000001(stores: []) --> KSTREAM-KEY-SELECT-0000000002 <-- KSTREAM-SOURCE-0000000000
    Processor: KSTREAM-KEY-SELECT-0000000002(stores: []) --> KSTREAM-FILTER-0000000005 <-- KSTREAM-FLATMAPVALUES-0000000001
    Processor: KSTREAM-FILTER-0000000005(stores: []) --> KSTREAM-SINK-0000000004 <-- KSTREAM-KEY-SELECT-0000000002
    Sink: KSTREAM-SINK-0000000004(topic: counts-store-repartition) <-- KSTREAM-FILTER-0000000005
  Sub-topology: 1
    Source: KSTREAM-SOURCE-0000000006(topics: counts-store-repartition) --> KSTREAM-AGGREGATE-0000000003
    Processor: KSTREAM-AGGREGATE-0000000003(stores: [counts-store]) --> KTABLE-TOSTREAM-0000000007 <-- KSTREAM-SOURCE-0000000006
    Processor: KTABLE-TOSTREAM-0000000007(stores: []) --> KSTREAM-SINK-0000000008 <-- KSTREAM-AGGREGATE-0000000003
    Sink: KSTREAM-SINK-0000000008(topic: streams-wordcount-output) <-- KTABLE-TOSTREAM-0000000007
Global Stores:
  none
```

As we can see above, the topology now contains two disconnected
sub-topologies. The first sub-topology\'s sink node
`KSTREAM-SINK-0000000004` will write to a repartition topic
`counts-store-repartition`, which will be read by the second
sub-topology\'s source node `KSTREAM-SOURCE-0000000006`. The repartition
topic is used to \"shuffle\" the source stream by its aggregation key,
which is in this case the value string. In addition, inside the first
sub-topology a stateless `KSTREAM-FILTER-0000000005` node is injected
between the grouping `KSTREAM-KEY-SELECT-0000000002` node and the sink
node to filter out any intermediate record whose aggregate key is empty.

In the second sub-topology, the aggregation node
`KSTREAM-AGGREGATE-0000000003` is associated with a state store named
`counts-store` (the name is specified by the user in the `count`
operator). Upon receiving each record from its upcoming stream source
node, the aggregation processor will first query its associated
`counts-store` store to get the current count for that key, augment by
one, and then write the new count back to the store. Each updated count
for the key will also be piped downstream to the
`KTABLE-TOSTREAM-0000000007` node, which interpret this update stream as
a record stream before further piping to the sink node
`KSTREAM-SINK-0000000008` for writing back to Kafka.

The complete code looks like this (assuming lambda expression is used):

              .count(Materialized.<String, Long, KeyValueStore<Bytes, byte[]>>as("counts-store"))
